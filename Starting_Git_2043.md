Notes for starting git in 2043

Step 1, get an online github.com account.
Your user name for reference: jeremy.evert@swosu.edu

Step 2, Use a machine that has git installed.

Step 3, go to the command prompt and lets get started.

Big idea: Get to your folder.

use *dir* to find out what is in the directory.
```
C:\Users\LAB>dir
 Volume in drive C is OS
 Volume Serial Number is 864D-605F

 Directory of C:\Users\LAB

06/21/2012  01:13 PM    <DIR>          .
06/21/2012  01:13 PM    <DIR>          ..

               0 File(s)              0 bytes
              13 Dir(s)  406,076,936,192 bytes free		  
```
Change directory to the Desktop using *cd* and your file name.
```
C:\Users\LAB>cd Desktop
```
Look in the directory for our file using *dir*
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop>dir
 Volume in drive C is OS
 Volume Serial Number is 864D-605F

 Directory of C:\Users\LAB\Desktop

11/05/2015  08:12 AM    <DIR>          .
11/05/2015  08:12 AM    <DIR>          ..
11/05/2015  08:13 AM    <DIR>          2043_git_Practice
06/21/2012  02:16 PM             1,553 Report Problems-ITS.lnk
               1 File(s)          1,553 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  406,076,936,192 bytes free
```
Change directories to our folder using *cd*
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop>cd 2043_git_Practice
```
And now we are ready to begin.
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>
```

Big idea 2: Set up your git folder.
1. Go to github.com
2. Sign in
3. Create a new repository 
(this is usually a big green button with a + mark)
4. Name the new repository
5. Provide a meaningful description in the repository.
This should try to answer 5 questions:
Who?
What?
Where?
When?
Why?

Step 6: Do not select the button
to initialize the folder with a readme file.

Step 7: Follow the instructions on Github.com for:
â€¦or create a new repository on the command line
echo # 2043_2015_11_05_Practice >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jeremy-evert/2043_2015_11_05_Practice.git
git push -u origin master

Now I will show those instructions and their results 
inside the command prompt.
I will copy and paste one line at a time
from github.com into my command prompt and then 
execute it.
After I have finished executing these lines, 
I will copy the command prompt over and comment it.

Below is my command prompt activity.

1. Make a readme.md file.
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>echo # 2043_2015_11_05_Practice >> README
.md
```
Initilize the git folder.
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/LAB/Desktop/2043_git_Practice/.git/
```
add my readme.md folder
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>git add README.md
```
C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>git add .

C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>git commit -m "first commit"

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'LAB@STF126W-PC.(none)')

C:\Users\LAB\Desktop\2043_git_Practice>git push
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
